Warning: Strongly suggest user to use inputs in ''normalization_director_test''.
As ansitropic director without normalization will strengthen the material(compared to isotropic case), which violates physical intuition.

A 2D anisotropic simulation is included,

1. AD stands for auto differentiation, NA means non-AD version.

2. The metal is assumed to have weak plan with 45 deg from x-axis,
hence, the normal vector is n = [-0.70710678, 0.70710678, 0]

3. In the folder 2D_angle_input_tests, 
the anisotropic director accepts as input the counter-clockwise angle (measured from the x-axis) that defines the tangential direction of the weak plane.
