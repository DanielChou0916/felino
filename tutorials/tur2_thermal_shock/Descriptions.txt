Test the fatigue behavior under heating process.
Losely coupling is used for all systems, i.e., the residual terms for displacement, temperature and damage are calculated individually.
Interactions between physics systems only exist in material parameters.

1. Temperature variation is 700K, which is set in fatigue_load_T.

2. Max temperature affects Gc, it's assigned in _disp, and _f files.
